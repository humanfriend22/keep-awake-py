# Keep Computer Awake (in Python)

A simple Python script that moves the cursor (slightly) based off of the starting position. It also exits when the cursor is moved out of the target positions 3 times. This way, if you can't get back to the terminal, it will auto-exit.

Simply Run:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
